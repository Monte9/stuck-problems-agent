# Who owns the dark fleet: a 214-vessel ledger, a flag-state carding dossier, and the first test cases for the WTO fisheries subsidies treaty

## Abstract

Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is worth up to $23.5 billion a year [1], and the industry it feeds kills more than 100,000 workers annually [2]. Detection is solved: satellite radar shows roughly 75% of industrial fishing vessels absent from public tracking [3]. Attribution is not. This project converted open data into named accountability in four steps: a deduplicated ledger of all 214 currently IUU-listed vessels, an ownership league table, a flag-state risk dossier for DG MARE's next carding round, and a subsidy-to-operator docket for the WTO Fisheries Subsidies Agreement. Three headline results: half the listed fleet (107 of 214) has no named owner and 69.6% is stateless; the RFMO blacklists and the largest reported corporate offenders barely intersect (one company in common with FTC's top ten); and three confirmed subsidy-to-IUU-operator links (at least €8.2M from Spain and the EU to Vidal Armadores, $19.0M from China to Pingtan in 2021, €1.8M from Spain to Albacora) all predate the treaty. The recommended first move costs a letter: an Article 8 question that subsidizing members must answer on the record, anchored to the 15 September 2026 notification deadline.

## Background

Fishing kills more workers than any other industry: over 100,000 deaths a year, four times the old FAO/ILO figure [2]. At least 128,000 fishers are trapped in forced labor at sea [4]. IUU fishing drains up to $11.5 billion a year from Africa alone [5]. The detection problem is closed: Global Fishing Watch's 2024 *Nature* study mapped every large vessel at sea with Sentinel-1 radar and published the detections as open data [3]. Two enforcement levers also exist. The EU's carding system has issued 28 yellow and 6 red cards since 2012 and measurably reformed Thailand and Belize [6], and its CATCH digital certification system, mandatory since 10 January 2026, processes 250,000 catch certificates a year with real-time risk alerts [7]. The WTO Fisheries Subsidies Agreement entered into force on 15 September 2025 and bans subsidies to operators engaged in IUU fishing [8]. Both levers bite only against named operators, and naming is the unstaffed grind: shareholder data exists for only 16% of vessels implicated in IUU fishing [9]. The precedent that desk attribution works is concrete: an Environmental Justice Foundation investigation led Oman to revoke the ISRAR fleet's registration on 13 July 2022 [10], and Spain's Operation Sparrow fined the Vidal Armadores network €17.84M in 2015 [11].

## Method

Five milestones, each generated and then judged by an independent fresh-eyes evaluator that saw only the done-criteria and the artifact; all five passed on the first attempt, with live citation spot-checks recorded in each verdict. M1 verified 28 open data sources by fetch on 2026-06-12 ([inventory](artifacts/2026-06-12-m1-open-data-source-inventory.md)). M2 machine-parsed eight IUU lists end to end (608 source records) and deduplicated them on IMO numbers, name variants, and rename joins ([ledger](artifacts/2026-06-12-m2-consolidated-iuu-vessel-ledger.md)). M3 attributed owners using RFMO owner fields, CCAMLR ownership histories, TMT registry research, and court records, with per-attribution confidence labels ([league table](artifacts/2026-06-12-m3-beneficial-owner-league-table.md)). M4 ranked 19 flag states by unaddressed risk, scored on listed-fleet ties, dark-activity evidence, and forced-labor evidence, discounted by carding-lever headroom ([dossier](artifacts/2026-06-12-m4-dg-mare-carding-dossier.md)). M5 traced subsidy programs to those operators against the treaty's Article 3 text ([docket](artifacts/2026-06-12-m5-wto-article3-subsidy-docket.md)).

## Findings

### 1. The IUU blacklists and the biggest corporate offenders are watching different fleets

The naive expectation is that the official lists name the worst actors. They do not. Of the ten companies FTC identified in 2022 as owning a quarter of reported IUU vessels [9], exactly one (CNFC) can be tied to a currently RFMO-listed vessel, and that hull was reportedly broken up in 2020. The concentration finding itself replicates: the top 10 ownership networks behind the current lists hold 45 vessels, 21.0% of the ledger, against FTC's 23.7%. But the names change almost completely. RFMO lists capture the stateless fringe; the largest reported corporate offenders (Pingtan, CNFC, the Dalian fleets) keep their vessels off the lists because their offences are handled as licensing matters that never reach an RFMO listing. The M3 artifact is explicit that this is partly a fact about the instrument, not the fleet: RFMO listing is blind to flagged corporate fleets.

### 2. Half the listed fleet is ownerless and 69.6% is stateless

The 214-vessel ledger merges 608 records from eight lists with zero IMO conflicts. 107 vessels (50.0%) carry at least one named owner or operator (88 confirmed, 18 probable, 1 reported-only); 107 carry none, because the listing bodies themselves publish owner "unknown". 149 vessels (69.6%) are recorded stateless. Only 66 (30.8%) have an IMO number. The largest identified owner of currently listed hulls is Shandong Lanyue Ocean Fishery Co Ltd (Rongcheng, China), a company in nobody's prior top ten.

| Rank | Owner / network | Jurisdiction | Vessels | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Shandong Lanyue Ocean Fishery | China | 12 | confirmed (5 hulls) / probable (7 identities) |
| 2 | Shidao Group (via subsidiaries) | China | 6 | probable, contested by China's ministry |
| 3 | Huang Jia Yi (individual) | Taiwan address | 5 | confirmed as listed |
| 4 | "Al Wesam" / Somali Seven network | Djibouti / Somalia / Thailand | 5 | confirmed / probable |
| 5 | Vidal Armadores network | Spain (via shells) | 5 | confirmed (historical) |

### 3. The EU's carding lever has never touched the heaviest evidence stacks

Of 19 flag states ranked, the two largest evidence stacks sit on states the EU has never carded or has delisted. China (never carded) flags 8 listed vessels, hosts the two largest ownership networks, and carries forced-labor determinations from three US agencies (CBP fleet-wide withhold release order 2021, DOL TVPRA listing, NOAA 2023 identification) [12, 13]. Taiwan (delisted 2019) has Kaohsiung and Pingtung owners named with street addresses for 7 listed vessels, and every adverse US finding post-dates the delisting. India flags 27 listed vessels, the largest national bloc, with new IOTC batch listings in each of five consecutive years, and has never been carded while exporting $1.13 billion of seafood to the EU [14]. The dossier names four yellow-card candidates (China, Taiwan, India at dialogue stage, Vanuatu) and one structural blind spot: the highest AIS-disabling fraction in the peer-reviewed record belongs to Spain (up to 14%), an EU member constitutionally outside the carding instrument [15].

### 4. Three confirmed subsidy-to-IUU-operator links, all pre-treaty, which makes Article 8 the lever

| Link | Subsidy (documented) | IUU determination | Overlap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spain/EU → Vidal Armadores | ≥€8.2M, mid-1990s–2010 [16] | CCAMLR listings 2003–08, still in force; €17.84M Spanish fines 2015 [11] | Yes: aid paid at least 7 years while vessels were listed |
| China → Pingtan / Fuzhou Honglong | RMB 400M state equity 2015; $19.0M subsidy Jan–Sep 2021 (SEC filings) [17] | Indonesia 2016; Ecuador criminal conviction 2017; OFAC designation 2022 | Yes: subsidy income rose 112% in 2020, 3–4 years after determinations |
| Spain/EU → Albacora S.A. | €1.8M to fish foreign waters, plus subsidized construction [16] | NOAA: $5M settlement, 67 counts admitted, then its largest-ever penalty | Yes: grant came after the US action |

Every documented payment predates the treaty's entry into force, so none is directly actionable. What is actionable is the question. The determinations are in force today; the channels are documented; Article 8 obliges members to notify determinations and implementation measures by 15 September 2026 [8]. A member tabling written questions (does China grant or maintain any subsidy to Shandong Lanyue, CNFC, or the Pingtan network; does Spain maintain any eligibility for Albacora or Vidal successors) creates a record with no compliant non-answer.

## Recommendations

| Item | Executor | Cost | Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Article 8 written questions on Lanyue, CNFC, Pingtan, Albacora, Vidal successors | Any WTO member delegation (Ecuador, the US, and the EU each hold determinations) | A letter; no new budget | Article 8.3 notifications due 15 Sep 2026 |
| Pre-identification dialogue with China; re-carding review of Taiwan and Vanuatu | DG MARE | Existing instrument; no new legal authority | Ghana's 2021 second card proves delisting is reversible |
| CATCH risk-flagging of PRC- and Taiwan-linked catch certificates | DG MARE and member-state authorities | Configuration of a live system | CATCH mandatory since 10 Jan 2026, 250,000 certificates/yr [7] |
| Carry the ledger, league table, and docket into formal channels | GFW Joint Analytical Cell, FTC, EJF | Desk work; the full five-artifact chain here was produced in one day over open data | Oman deflagged the ISRAR fleet after exactly this kind of dossier [10] |

Sequence: the WTO question goes first because the deadline is fixed and the cost is a letter. The carding dialogue runs in parallel; it is slow by design and the evidence file is already assembled. CATCH flagging needs no diplomacy and converts this dossier into import-control practice immediately.

## Limitations

1. Cross-listed RFMO records share provenance: IOTC, ICCAT, NAFO and TMT republish each other, so a single originating clerical error would propagate. Rows resting only on such records are flagged "shared provenance" in M3.
2. The largest ownership attribution (Shandong Lanyue) rests on one research organization's registry work; the second (Shidao) is contested by China's own ministry, which told NPFC the sighted hulls were not the authorized vessels.
3. No post-September-2025 subsidy payment is documented anywhere in the docket. China stopped publicly reporting distant-water fuel subsidies in 2012; Pingtan ceased SEC reporting after 2021. Absence of payment evidence is partly absence of disclosure.
4. Flag counts are poor proxies for harm. India's 27 vessels are small gillnetters; tonnage-weighted, India falls several ranks. The M4 weights are judgment made explicit, not measurement.
5. Access friction shaped the work: OpenCorporates served captchas, EUR-Lex blocked automated retrieval, OECD returned 403s. Card statuses were reconstructed from COM(2024) 171 and press releases; a missed 2025–26 decision is possible.
6. The ledger is the listable tip, not the dark fleet: ~75% of detected industrial fishing is untracked and almost none of it is listed [3]. Listing is also not adjudicated guilt; several entries rest on single sightings.
7. The forced-labor evidence stack comes from three agencies of one government (CBP, DOL, NOAA), so it is correlated, and the underlying AIS risk model has a published challenge in the literature.
