# Where the next dollar against childhood lead poisoning should go: a 25-country triage

**Abstract.** About 800 million children, one in three worldwide, have blood lead at or above 5 µg/dL, enough to permanently reduce IQ (UNICEF/Pure Earth, 2020). Attributed deaths run from 1.5 million per year (Global Burden of Disease) to 5.5 million (Lancet Planetary Health, 2023). Yet pooled child blood-lead measurements exist for only 34 of roughly 137 low- and middle-income countries [1], so most national burden figures are model outputs that cannot tell a regulator which source to act against. This note reports a four-stage desk triage: a dataset inventory across 25 high-burden countries, a weighted 10-country shortlist, source-attribution grading for the top three, and an enforcement dossier for the first-ranked country. Three findings: greenfield entry is largely gone (one program already covers seven of the most tractable countries); the top candidates each hold half the evidence they need; and the highest-value target, Indonesia, lacks enforcement, not law. The recommended core package is $0.9M–2.9M, led by a $150k–350k contamination-plus-blood map of Jakarta's informal smelter clusters.

## Background

Lead's cost in 2019 alone is estimated at 765 million IQ points and $1.4 trillion in lost lifetime income, up to roughly 8% of GDP in the poorest countries (World Bank). The remediation problem is source attribution: the dominant exposure source differs by country (paint, turmeric adulterated with lead chromate, informal battery recycling, glazed cookware, kohl cosmetics), and a modeled burden number cannot say which one to regulate.

Funding is thin and recently disrupted. Global spending ran near $15 million per year until 2024. The $150 million USAID/UNICEF Partnership for a Lead-Free Future was gutted in early 2025 with USAID's dismantling. The largest remaining funder is Open Philanthropy's $104 million Lead Exposure Action Fund (LEAF), which must allocate by end of 2027 [5].

The precedent for cheap wins exists. In Bangladesh, researchers traced child exposure to turmeric adulterated with lead chromate, then paired media pressure, work with mill owners, and handheld-XRF enforcement by the food-safety authority. Turmeric with detectable lead fell from 47% (2019) to 0% (2021); mill workers' blood lead fell about 30%; cost was roughly $1 per DALY averted [6, 7]. Measurement is also starting to move: Bhutan ran its first national child survey in 2024 and found 75.9% of children aged 1–6 above 3.5 µg/dL [10].

## Method

Four desk-research stages, one artifact each: (1) an inventory of 14 blood-lead and product-contamination datasets and a coverage matrix for the 25 highest-burden countries; (2) a weighted shortlist (burden 25%, data gap 25%, tractability 30%, program whitespace 20%) scored over 10 candidates; (3) A/B/C evidence-graded source attribution for the top three; (4) a regulator-ready enforcement dossier for the first-ranked country, adapted from the Bangladesh playbook. Each artifact passed an independent evaluator that checks pre-registered done-criteria and spot-checks citations against sources before the next stage runs; all five stages passed on first attempt. Artifacts and verdicts are in [this repository](https://github.com/Monte9/stuck-problems-agent/tree/main/problems/lead-poisoning).

## Findings

### 1. Greenfield entry is gone; the highest-burden giants rank low

| Rank | Country | Burden (25%) | Gap (25%) | Tractability (30%) | Whitespace (20%) | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Indonesia | 4 | 4 | 4 | 2 | **3.60** |
| 2 | Egypt | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **3.50** |
| 3 | Philippines | 3 | 3 | 5 | 2 | **3.40** |
| 4 | DR Congo | 4 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 3.35 |
| 5 | Vietnam | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3.30 |
| 6 | Nigeria | 5 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 3.25 |
| 7 | Pakistan | 5 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 3.25 |
| 8 | Peru | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 3.10 |
| 9 | India | 5 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3.10 |
| 10 | Ethiopia | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2.95 |

Pure Earth's LEAF-funded program, started in late 2024, already covers Colombia, Egypt, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Peru, and the Philippines: seven of the most tractable high-burden countries at once. India, Nigeria, and Pakistan score 5 of 5 on burden but land in the bottom half: hard to operate in and already covered by every major program. The marginal value is not entering new countries. It is deepening existing ones, linking measured sources to measured blood.

### 2. Each top candidate holds half the evidence it needs

The Philippines has product data and no blood data: a 2021–22 market survey of 856 samples found lead above thresholds in 33% of cosmetics, 24% of metal cookware, 16% of paints, and 13% of ceramic foodware, but no recent national child blood-lead survey exists to say which source poisons children [12]. Indonesia is the inverse: direct child blood-lead measurements near smelters, no national product survey. Egypt has neither. Its strongest evidence is a decade-old Cairo study (pottery-workshop children averaged 43.3 µg/dL), it has no lead limit for ceramics, and its 2022 paint decree still permits 5,000 ppm in colored paints. Five high-burden countries (DRC, Afghanistan, Yemen, Myanmar, Madagascar) have no usable blood-lead survey of any kind.

### 3. The first-ranked target needs enforcement, not legislation

Indonesia has classified spent lead-acid batteries as hazardous waste since 2014 and bans unlicensed smelting under Government Regulation 22/2021 and Ministry of Environment Regulation 6/2021. The ministry has issued about 5 smelting permits; Pure Earth estimates more than 200 illegal smelting sites, 34 in greater Jakarta. In a 2019 study of three Greater Jakarta neighborhoods with informal battery recycling, 47% of children aged 1–5 had blood lead at or above 5 µg/dL [2]. The ministry's hazardous-waste director-general has said publicly that authorities "can't close" the smelters: operators would lose their livelihoods and relocate to hidden sites [8]. The binding constraint is evidence that makes enforcement politically survivable, and an exit path that prevents displacement.

## Recommendations

| # | Line item | Executor | Cost | Anchor |
|---|-----------|----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Georeferenced contamination-plus-blood map of Jakarta's smelter clusters | Pure Earth + university partners; KLHK owns enforcement | $150k–350k | Rapid Market Screening at ~$36.8k/country [9]; Bhutan survey lab equipment ~$215k [10] |
| 2 | Formal-sector battery-recycling off-ramp pilot, before any closures | Licensed smelters + KPBB | $0.5M–2M | LEAF has committed >$20M including Indonesia battery work [5] |
| 3 | Egypt + Philippines product screening and first child blood-lead baselines | Pure Earth, EcoWaste Coalition | $175k–400k | RMS per-country cost [9] |

Core package: $0.9M–2.9M against LEAF's $104M envelope. The sequencing departs from the Bangladesh playbook in one deliberate way: the off-ramp precedes enforcement. Turmeric mills could stop adding pigment at near-zero cost; smelting is the operator's entire income, so enforcement without an exit produces displacement, not elimination.

## Limitations

1. The grade-A evidence for Indonesia rests on a single 2019 cross-sectional study. If it is unrepresentative, the priority ordering shifts. Line item 1 partly exists to re-establish that signal at scale.
2. Smelter counts come from NGO estimates and journalism, not audited registries.
3. The 30% tractability weight is a value judgment. A funder optimizing raw burden would rank India and Nigeria higher.
4. Cost anchors are cost-effectiveness ratios, not line-item budgets. Treat every figure as order-of-magnitude.
5. LEAF and Pure Earth's 2026 Audacious Project funding may already cover parts of this package; additionality is unverified.
6. Money cannot buy the two real constraints: trained field teams and a regulator's willingness to act. The map lowers the political cost of enforcement. The decision stays in Jakarta.
